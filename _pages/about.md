<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Hi there! 

I'm Wei-Han (Zoe) Hsu, a second-year Data Science master's student at New York University. My enthusiasm lies in researching, constructing, and implementing algorithms to address tangible challenges across industries.

Currently, I'm deeply engaged in pioneering anomaly detection for network flows, employing autoencoders as a machine learning engineer within NYU-IT's [HSRN, High-Speed Research Network](https://vip.hsrn.nyu.edu/) department. Excited about the ever-evolving landscape of data science and its real-world applications, I'm committed to pushing boundaries and making meaningful contributions in both medical and cybersecurity domains.

Feel free to join me on this exciting journey! You can reach out to me via Email or connect on [LinkedIn](linkedin.com/in/wei-han-zoe-hsu-62b58a158).
