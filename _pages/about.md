<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->

Hi there!

I'm Wei-Han (Zoe) Hsu 徐薇涵.

I’m a Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer with hands-on experience across healthcare, marketing, and cybersecurity. My work bridges the gap between complex data and actionable insights, with a particular passion for building end-to-end ML solutions that drive real-world impact.

Currently, I work at Lasa Health, a health AI startup, where I lead the development of predictive models and automation tools for clinical decision support in women’s health. From processing massive EHR datasets to deploying machine learning pipelines using tools like Docker, Kubernetes, and AWS, I specialize in transforming raw data into meaningful, scalable solutions.

I thrive on continuous learning—whether through building side projects like an NLP-driven financial chatbot, or mastering new frameworks and tools. I’m especially driven by opportunities to make data science both practical and impactful.

Feel free to explore my work or reach out via Email or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/weihanz-hsu/). Let’s connect!
